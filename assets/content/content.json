Having exposure to the vast array of clinical conditions affecting a person’s feet can lead you in many different areas of practice. Options include sports podiatry, surgery, dermatology, paediatrics and now forensics along with staying in education and teaching settings. Being able to specialise but also maintain a broad clinical practice enables you to keep your options wide open."
